Geckoboard Custom CSS
==========
Starter custom CSS stylesheets for styling your Geckoboard dashboards

Options
---
You have the option of using the SCSS stylesheets in the `scss` directory which
use Compass and SASS to make it easy to alter your dashboard CSS settings via
quick to configure variables or you may take the generated CSS stylesheet and
make the desired changes to that file directly

## SCSS
To use the SCSS stylesheets you will need to have Ruby installed. With Ruby
installed you can install compass `gem install compass`.
[Compass](http://compass-style.org/) is a CSS framework built upon
[SASS](http://sass-lang.com/). These stylesheets are located in the `scss`
directory.

## CSS
You may take the ready made CSS stylesheets which were generated using the SCSS
stylesheets described above and alter these directly. These stylesheets are in
the `css` directory.
