  Geckoboard Custom CSS
  ---

  This stylesheet allows you to quickly customise your awesome Geckoboards
  using [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/)

  You will need to have Ruby installed on your machine to run the build
  process that compiles this file into a stylesheet ready to upload using
  the custom CSS option when configuring your dashboard from within the
  Geckoboard application. With Ruby installed you can run `gem install
  compass` to install the compass gem then `compass compile` to build the
  stylesheet which you can then find in the `css` directory.

  To quickly configure your dashbaords look and feel you can adjust the
  values of the variables at the top of each section.

  ## Dashboard styles
  There isn't much to the dashboard, it's just a place for widgets. You can
  change the background color and add a background image here though

  ### Widget structure
  The anatomy of the widget in it's basic form is shown below, you can target
  the individual widgets using the id which carries the unique id of each
  widget shown here as `{{id}}`

      <article class="widget" id="widget-{{id}}">
        <div class="widget-inner widget-size-1x1">
          <section class="widget-body clock-widget no-title">
            <div class="widget-canvas"></div>
          </section>
          <footer></footer>
        </div>
      </article>

  You can set the widget colouring by altering the above variables, edit here
